The [blast-galley](https://github.com/zwets/blast-galley) is my personal collection of scripts and utilities to make working with the [NCBI Blast+ suite](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1763/) easier.  Documentation and usage examples are in its source code repository at <https://github.com/zwets/blast-galley>.
