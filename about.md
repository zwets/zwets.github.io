## Introducing io.zwets.it

Io is Zwets is Marco van Zwetselaar.  For [many](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://zwets.com/) years\* my digital namespace has been [zwets.com](http://zwets.com/).  I am still there but have forked the coder part of my identity to zwets.it.  Not so much for the blogging, more for the convenience of having a corner of the internet to keep things on.

### So who is zwets@zwets.com?

My wife and I use [zwets.com](http://zwets.com/) to blog about our life and work in Moshi, Tanzania.  She is a neurologist at [KCMC Hospital](http://www.kcmc.ac.tz/).  I work as a software programmer and bioinformatician at the associated [Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute (KCRI)](http://www.kcri.ac.tz/).

### And who is io@zwets.it?

My professional career started in academic research somewhere in the past millennium.  Then there was a twenty year stint in commercial IT ([details](http://tz.linkedin.com/in/zwets)).  Now I am back in research, enjoying my bioinformatics work in the genomics team at KCRI.  Our main line of work is in bacterial whole genome sequencing, focusing on antibiotic resistance.

#### Io is a programmer

I have worked in a variety of fields, with one prominent constant: **programming**.  I love it.  I must have typed my first line of BASIC around 1979, on a Philips P2000.  Then came Pascal and LISP in the 80s -- as well as an obscure DBase 3 language which is all but lost in the haze.  I spent the 90/00s professionally cranking out mlocs of C, C++ and Java, with a painful intermezzo of VB+ASP, and some pleasant sidesteps into Prolog, Smalltalk and Erlang.  Also XSLT needs mention, the one bright light in the dark ages of XML.  Then there were Javascript, Ruby, and recreational excursions to the likes of Newspeak, Pure, Coq and Parallel Brainfuck.  My current day to day languages are Bash/GNU, Python, R, and Haskell.  Next up is Guile, as it is the specification language for [GNU/Guix](http://www.gnu.org/software/guix), an appealing approach to software distribution.

#### Why IO?

I started this site when I found out that I could conveniently host so-called "GitHub Pages" at zwets.github.io, while using a domain name of my own.  The **io** in the name stuck.  Apart from it being fitting in a geeky way, you can ask any Italian why io makes sense. 

#### \*) Footnotes

* Apart from a fun stroll down memory lane, the [WaybackMachine](http://web.archive.org/) / [Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org/) provides the useful service of on-demand archiving of copies of web pages, so you can reliably cite them for later referral.
* I remember the day the Internet Archive [made its existence known](http://web.archive.org/web/20011026003810/http://www.archive.org/wayback/press_kit/index.html).  We thought it was a joke but it had already spent 5 years archiving pages, resulting in a then [gargantuan volume](http://web.archive.org/web/20011202145626/http://www.waybackmachine.org/) of 10 billion pages, 100TB.
* The WaybackMachine will be [redesigned in 2017](http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/22/9593656/internet-archive-wayback-machine-redesign-announced).
