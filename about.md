## Introducing io.zwets.it

Io is Zwets is Marco van Zwetselaar.  For [many](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://zwets.com/) years\* my digital namespace has been [zwets.com](http://zwets.com/). I am still there but have forked the coder part of my identity to here.

### So who is zwets@zwets.com?

My wife and I use http://zwets.com/ to blog about our life and work in Moshi, Tanzania.  She is a neurologist at [KCMC Hospital](http://www.kcmc.ac.tz/).  I work as a software programmer and bioinformatician at the associated [Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute (KCRI)](http://www.kcri.ac.tz/).

### And who is io@zwets.it?

My professional career started in academic research somewhere in the past millennium.  Then there was a twenty year stint in commercial IT ([details](http://tz.linkedin.com/in/zwets)).  Now I am back in research, enjoying my bioinformatics work in the genomics team at KCRI.  Our main line of work is in bacterial whole genome sequencing, focusing on antibiotic resistance.

#### Io is a programmer

I have worked in a variety of fields, but with one prominent constant throughout: **programming**.  I've loved it from my first lines of BASIC, Pascal and LISP in the 80s, through Mlocs of C, C++ and Java in the 90/00s, to my current-day mix of Python, R, and glorious Haskell.  Along the way, there were pleasant times in Prolog, Smalltalk and Erlang, and recreational excursions to the likes of Pure, Coq and Parallel Brainfuck.  And not a day passes without the simple joy of GNU and Bash.

I *love* programming.

#### \*) Footnotes

* Apart from a fun stroll down memory lane, the [WaybackMachine](http://web.archive.org/) / [Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org/) provides the useful service of on-demand archiving of copies of web pages, so you can reliably cite them for later referral.
* I remember the day the Internet Archive [made its existence known](http://web.archive.org/web/20011026003810/http://www.archive.org/wayback/press_kit/index.html).  We thought it was a joke but it had already spent 5 years archiving pages, resulting in a then [gargantuan volume](http://web.archive.org/web/20011202145626/http://www.waybackmachine.org/) of 10 billion pages, 100TB.
* The WaybackMachine will be [redesigned in 2017](http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/22/9593656/internet-archive-wayback-machine-redesign-announced).
* Note to self: write-up on the *not-so-pleasant* languages and platforms ... VB, DCOM, XSD, SOAP, ...
