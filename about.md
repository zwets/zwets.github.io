## io.zwets.it

You have reached [io.zwets.it](http://io.zwets.it/about), Marco van Zwetselaar's professional domain.  I'm also at [zwets.com](https://zwets.com), my family's digital namespace since [many](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://zwets.com/) years[^1].

#### Who is io@zwets.it?

My professional career started in academic research somewhere in the last millennium.  Then there was a twenty year stint in commercial IT (<a href="http://tz.linkedin.com/in/zwets">details</a>).  I then moved back into research, and have since been immersed in genomics and bioinformatics.  After ten years building from scratch [KCRI](https://www.kcri.ac.tz)'s bioinformatics unit, I moved on in March 2023 to continue as an independent [Bioinformatician without Borders](http://io.zwets.it/2023/03/01/bioinformatician-without-borders).  You can read [my CV here](cv.pdf).

I tremendously enjoyed setting up the bioinformatics unit at KCRI in Moshi, Tanzania.  This meant single-handedly building an affordable but adequate high-performance cluster (hpc.kcri.it), developing pipelines such as the [KCRI CGE Bacterial Analysis Pipeline (BAP)](https://github.com/kcri-tz/kcri-cge-bap), teaching basic and advanced bioinformatics courses, and performing countless analyses for projects around Africa -- including Tanzania's first and only [published SARS-CoV-2 genomes](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.1034682).  I hope to continue in this line of work, building local bioinformatics capacity at other sites in Africa.

#### Programming

Bioinformatics is my work, programming is my craft and passion.  I must have typed my first line of BASIC circa 1979 on a Philips P2000.  Then came Pascal and LISP in the 80s -- as well as an obscure DBase3 language which is all but lost in the haze.  I then rode the third AI wave of the early 90s, picking up Prolog and Scheme (and a heap of mathematical statistics), along with an understanding of the beautifully austere formalism that underlies all computing: the lambda calculus.

When ~~play time~~ university was over, I spent the 90s and 00s professionally cranking out megalocs of C, C++ and Java.  There was a painful intermezzo of VB+ASP[^2], but side projects in Smalltalk and Erlang made up for it.  I saw the dawn and dusk of the dark ages of XML, with XSLT the one bright light.  I witnessed the rise of Javascript and the second coming of Python.  Recreational excursions into the likes of Newspeak, Pure, Coq, and Parallel Brainfuck kept me sharp. In short, I have a thing with programming.

My current day-to-day languages are Bash/GNU, Python, C++ and (reluctantly) R.  Haskell is my favourite programming language, by far.  I'm open to programming assignments, provided they don't involve front-end work and can be done with open source tools on Linux.  I don't take well to code bloat.

#### Why **io**@zwets.it?

I started this site when GitHub enabled personal domains for github.io pages.  I already owned zwets.it, the <strong>io</strong> stuck, and so it became io.zwets.it.  Apart from the geeky pun, ask any Italian why I/O makes sense.

[^1]: I remember the day that the Internet Archive [made its existence known](http://web.archive.org/web/20011026003810/http://www.archive.org/wayback/press_kit/index.html).  We thought it was a joke but it had already spent 5 years archiving pages, resulting in the then [gargantuan volume](http://web.archive.org/web/20011202145626/http://www.waybackmachine.org/) of 10 billion pages, 100TB.  Apart from a fun stroll down memory lane, the [WaybackMachine](http://web.archive.org/) / [Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org/) provides the useful service of on-demand archiving of copies of web pages, so you can reliably cite them for later referral.
