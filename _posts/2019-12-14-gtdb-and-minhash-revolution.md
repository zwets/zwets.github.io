Being a bioinformatician at heart, I can't help but feel that a little
revolution is happening at the confluence of two recent developments in
microbial genomics and bioinformatics.

The first is the advent of the [GTDB](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/), a
new (but by no means novel) approach to bacterial taxonomic assignment.
Boldy going where we didn't dare go before, 
[Parks c.s.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.4229) throw off the shackles of
pre-genomic microbiology in favour of taxonomic assignment based on degrees
of genomic similarity.

The second development is the rise of MinHash, a computational approach
designed 20 years ago for [massive scale document comparison](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SEQUEN.1997.666900),
and introduced to genomics by [Ondov c.s.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/029827)
in the [Mash](https://github.com/marbl/Mash) tool.  Mash and its various
descendants (see the recent [Dashing paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1875-0)
for an overview) have enabled the efficient many-to-many comparison of large
genome collections.

It's exciting to see the possibilities opened up by these developments, and
an absolute joy to work in a field where these little revolutions still happen.
