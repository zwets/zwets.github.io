After ten years at [Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute](https://www.kcri.ac.tz),
I am excited to embark on a new venture: Zwets IT takes off!

As of today I am available for hire as an independent contractor in bioinformatics,
based in The Netherlands, but open for bioinformatics work around the world.

Despite some colourful suggestions for company names by friends and colleagues,
I've gone with pragmatic: Zwets IT (<http://zwets.it>).

It was a close call though for _The Flying Bioinformatician_, _Nomadic Bioinformatics_,
and especially _«Bio-informaticien sans Frontières»_. :-)

More about me [here](https://io.zwets.it/about), in [my CV](https://io.zwets.it/cv.pdf),
