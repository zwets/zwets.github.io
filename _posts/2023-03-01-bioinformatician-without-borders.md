After ten years at [Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute](https://www.kcri.ac.tz),
I am excited to embark on a new venture: Zwets IT takes off!

As of today I am available for hire as an independent contractor in bioinformatics,
based in The Netherlands, but ready for bioinformatics work around the world.

Despite some colourful suggestions for company names by friends and colleagues
(how about _The Flying Bioinformatician_, or _Nomadic Bioinformatics_?), I've
gone with pragmatic: Zwets IT.

_«Bio-informaticien sans Frontières»_ almost made it though. :-)
