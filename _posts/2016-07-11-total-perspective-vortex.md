As a child I read about the Milky Way but never saw it.  I didn't 
realise that living at latitude 52N in a country where the sky is
always lit, meant that I couldn't easily see it there.
Last week, looking up at the pitch-black midnight sky from a beach
on the desolate Northeastern Tanzanian coast, I was suddenly aware that
that long and narrow cloud stretching out over the sky, wasn't a cloud
after all.

It was the Milky Way, and it's actually milky!  It's a diffuse cloud
of uncountably many tiny lights!  I used to think that I had a good
sense of how incredibly many stars there are out there, but this
just blew the lid off my perspective.  Here I was on a remote beach,
on a mostly harmless little planet orbiting its star, looking at the
other 100,000,000,000 stars in our galaxy.

Once you've grasped that perspective on Earth's sheer tininess 
and somewhat come to terms with our galactical insignificance, let's
put that perspective in perspective: the 100,000,000,000 stars
you see are only our galaxy.  Our galaxy is one of 200,000,000,000
galaxies.

Having put Earth in its place relative to the universe as a whole,
let's look at the position of us humans vis-a-vis all other life forms
on Earth.  There are a number of web sites cataloguing the so-called
*Tree of Life*, the evolutionary tree branching out into all known
(and many more unknown) species.  OneZoom (<http://onezoom.org>) takes 
this to a whole new level.

Spend some time [navigating the tree](http://www.onezoom.org/life.html),
then try to find the human species.  You probably won't, it's a long way
down.  This [dizzying trip](http://www.onezoom.org/life.html) takes you
there.  Welcome to the Evolutionary Total Perspective Vortex.
