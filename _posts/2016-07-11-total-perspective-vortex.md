As a child I read about the Milky Way but never saw it.  I didn't 
realise that living at latitude 52N in a country where the sky is
always lit, meant that I couldn't easily see it.
Last week, looking up at the pitch-black midnight sky from a beach
on the desolate Northeastern Tanzanian coast, I was suddenly aware that
that long and narrow cloud stretching out over the sky, wasn't a cloud
after all.

It was the Milky Way, and it's actually milky.  It's a diffuse cloud
of uncountably many tiny lights!  I used to think that I had a good
sense of how incredibly many stars there are out there, but this
just blew the lid off my perspective.  Here I was on a mostly harmless
little planet orbiting its star, looking at the other 100,000,000,000
stars in our galaxy.

Once you've grasped that perspective on Earth's sheer tininess 
and somewhat come to terms with our galactical insignificance, let's
put that perspective in perspective: the 100,000,000,000 stars
you see are only *our* galaxy.  Our galaxy is one of 200,000,000,000
galaxies.

Having seen Earth in its place relative to the universe as a whole,
here is the clincher.  Take a look at the position of us humans vis-a-vis
all other life forms on Earth.  A number of web sites catalogue the so-called
*Tree of Life*, the evolutionary tree branching out into all known
- and many more unknown - species.  [OneZoom](http://onezoom.org/) takes 
this to a whole new level.

Spend some time [navigating the tree](http://www.onezoom.org/life.html),
then try to find us, the species homo sapiens.  You probably won't, it's
a long way down.  This [dizzying trip](http://www.onezoom.org/life.html?init=zoom#Homininae) 
takes you there.  Welcome to the Evolutionary Total Perspective Vortex.
