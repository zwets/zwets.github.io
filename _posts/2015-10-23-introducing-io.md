# Introducing ... io@zwets.it

[For many years](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://zwets.com/) my 
digital namespace has been zwets.com. I am still [there](mailto:zwets@zwets.com)
but am moving the coder part of my identity to [zwets.it](http://io.zwets.it/).

## So who is zwets@zwets.com?

My wife and I use http://zwets.com/ to blog about our life and work in Tanzania.
She is a doctor at [KCMC hospital](http://www.kcmc.ac.tz), and I work as a
bioinformatician at the clinical research department, [KCRI](http://www.kcri.ac.tz),

So:

> io@zwets.it == zwets@zwets.com (personal) == Marco van Zwetselaar.

And also:

> io@zwets.it == zwets@kcri.ac.tz (work) == Marco van Zwetselaar

I code for fun and ~~profit~~food, so having a single identity for my hacker self
means I can carry it over between home and work, and between employers.

## Why not _zwets_@zwets.it?

Ah yes!  Working as an IT consultant I've had many company email addresses.
I remember my disappointment the first time an employer told me I could not choose
"zwets@..." but had to live with the company standard "firstname.surname@...".
How boring!  Still, I've always made a point of asking for an exception, and
sometimes one was made.

So what's with the **io**@zwets.it?  Well, apart from it being deep in a geeky
way (think: _port_), ask any Italian why it is obvious.

### Bootnotes

* Use the [WaybackMachine](http://web.archive.org/) to archive a copy of a web
  page in its current state, so you can reliably cite it later.
* I remember the day the Internet Archive [made its existence known](http://web.archive.org/web/20011026003810/http://www.archive.org/wayback/press_kit/index.html).
  We thought it was a joke but it had already spent 5 years archiving pages,
  resulting in a then [gargantuan volume](http://web.archive.org/web/20011202145626/http://www.waybackmachine.org/)
  of 10 billion pages, 100TB.
* The WaybackMachine will be [redesigned in 2017](http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/22/9593656/internet-archive-wayback-machine-redesign-announced).
