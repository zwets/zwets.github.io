Some days ago on the Guix-devel mailing list Florian Paul Schmidt [mentioned](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guix-devel/2015-11/msg00607.html) Redshift.  [Redshift](https://github.com/jonls/redshift/) adjusts the colour temperature of your screen according to the time of day, reducing strain on your eyes at night.

Now I don't want to sound all evangelistic, but if you regularly code at night: install it.  You'll wish someone had told you about this years ago.  Had Dr Dobbs [still been around]({% post_url 2015-12-16-farewell-dr-dobbs %}) then Redshift would get my vote for their all-time Programmer Productivity Award.
