Tonight I carried my youngest daughter (Vicky, 5 yo) from the car to our
house.  As I shut the car she said "Careful! I'm always worried that I
get my fingers caught between the door."

It actually happened twice over the past two weeks.  The usual accident:
a sibling closing the door while she was still getting out.  Three fingers
stuck at the hinge side ... owww!

We were lucky.  Land Rover hinges have plenty of play, so it was painful
but she still has all her fingers.

Vicky continued: "I'm worried because, you know, it hurts to get your
fingers stuck.  Three fingers hurts a lot.  One finger doesn't hurt so
much.  Two fingers I don't know.  I haven't tried."
