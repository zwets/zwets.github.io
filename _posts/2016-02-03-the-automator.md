In the early days of commercial IT in the Netherlands, before English became the standard vocabulary in the field that was later to be called "IT", the Dutch language had its own word for IT.  IT was called *automation* (automatisering) and people working in automation were called *automators* (automatiseerders).

The words now sound old-fashioned and have gotten into disuse to the extent that my children would conjure up an image of [Schwarzenegger](https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000931/) or [Doofenschmirz](https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0111656/) if I would tell them I am an **automator**.  

I like the term "automation" for our field of work.  It stresses the *purpose* of what we do rather than the means we use.  I am very much an automator.

Much of what I keep in my [public repositories](https://github.com/zwets) are shell scripts wrapping tedious, error-prone, or repetitious operations, that I think may be useful to others[^1].  They are operationalised documentation.  When you need to keep notes anyway[^2], it pays to put in the extra effort to condense all NTK into an executable script.  It's like having unit tests for your notes.

###### Footnotes

[^1]: Either straight off the shelf, like [taxo](https://github.com/zwets/blast-galley/blob/master/taxo) to search and browse the NCBI taxonomy, or as a starting point, like this [in-silico PCR script](https://github.com/zwets/blast-galley/blob/master/in-silico-pcr.sh).  Both are in my [blast-galley](https://github.com/zwets/blast-galley) repository.

[^2]: You don't?  I'd hold off the cheers until you cross the age of forty.
